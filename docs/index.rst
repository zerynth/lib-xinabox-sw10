XinaBox SW10
*************

This SW10 xChip is a temperature-to-digital converter using an on-chip band gap temperature sensor and Sigma-Delta A-to-D conversion technique with an over-temperature detection output. It is capable of measuring ambient temperature ranging from -55°C to +125°C. It is based on the `LM75 <http://www.ti.com/product/LM75A>`_ manufactured by Texas Instruments.

Please note, SW10 and all other xChips is currently only supported in Zerynth Studio with `XinaBox CW02 <https://docs.zerynth.com/latest/official/board.zerynth.xinabox_esp32/docs/index.html>`_. Review the `Quick Start <https://wiki.xinabox.cc/Quick-Start>`_ guide for interfacing xChips.
